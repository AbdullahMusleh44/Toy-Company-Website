		<h1>Security Considerations </h1>
		<div class="security">
		<!-- Security considerations research -->
		<p> There are several security considerations related to the Northumbria Toy Company website that need to be identified. First of all, Data confidentiality; where only specific people should be able to access specific information in the website such as only letting admins access the admin panel. Data integrity, where data should remain in the same way it has been set to, such as prices of toys not changing unless done through the database. Data availability, in which the access to the data should always be possible when it is required. Implementing a user system with different roles such as customer and administrator would help significantly, where only administrators should have access to the admin form with specific permissions. Also if this was to be implemented, then passwords stored in the database should be encrypted instead of storing plain text passwords. The company should also conduct vulnerability tests regularly to see if the website has any vulnerabilities that could be manipulated by people with malicious intent. Furthermore, a security expert company could be outsourced to monitor the website constantly and identify possible risks.</p>
		<p> There are several methods that should be implemented to minimize potential security risks. To begin with, a secure web hosting company should be chosen to host the website on. Input validation and sanitization should be taken seriously where data should be validated on both the clients and servers side. SQL queries should also be paramterised to prevent SQL injection into the database used and cross site scripting (XSS). Additionally, encryption should be used throughout the entire system ie. Encrypting databases/specific rows or table in the database (at rest encryption) or to implement the HTTPS protocol (in transit encryption) since it ensures that content cannot be changed and edited in transit between the server and client.</p>
